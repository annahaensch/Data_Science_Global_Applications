# Data Science for Global Applications

_This course material was originally prepared by [Anna Haensch](https://annahaensch.com/) and [Karin Knudson](https://karinknudson.com/) for Data Science for Global Applications taught at the Fletcher Graduate School of Global Affairs at Tufts University.  We wrote about some of our motivations and methodology for the 2022 SciPy Conference Proceedings in ["Python for Global Applications: teaching scientific Python in context to law and diplomacy students"](https://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2022/anna_haensch.html)_.

## Course Ouline

## The Policy Project 

A core throughline of this course is the policy project.  There are various checkpoints and benchmarks throughout the semester.  This project culminates with a final policy paper due at the end of the semester, as well as an in-class presentation of key findings and takeaways.  The critical checkpoints through the semester are as follows:
* __Statement of Policy Question__: Students will develop 2-3 possible policy questions to explore throughout the semester.  A brief explanation of each question will be given to give context to non-experts, and students will identify possible types of data that might be useful.  
* __Identification of Datasets of Interest__:  Students will choose one policy question of focus, and indentify 2-3 datasets that will help them answer this question.  Students will identify the steps necessary to acquire these datasets, but not necessarily carry these steps out (yet). 
* __Draft Data Audit__: Students will gain an understanding of the datasets they are using, with the goal of making sure that their data is reusable, and their work is reproducible.  This is also a mechanism for understanding the origins of the data to help uncover bias.  Precise text of the data audit assignment can he found [here](policy_project/data_audit_assignment.md).  
* __Draft Data Visualization__: Students will use the knowledge gained in the data visualization module of the course to create at least one compelling visualization of their data.  Visualizations will be accompanied by ~100 word alt-text.
* __Presentation__: Students will create a concise one-slide presentation highlighting key takeaways from the project and at leat one illustrative data visualization. Students will present this slide in conversation with the class. 
* __Policy Paper__: Students will prepare a policy paper that specifically addresses their policy question.  This paper will include a "Data Overview" section which contains a narrative version of the data audit a "Methodology" section that includes details of models used, a "Results" section that discusses model output and validation, and a "Conclusions" section that frames results in terms of the posed policy question. The rubric for the policy paper and presentation is below.
